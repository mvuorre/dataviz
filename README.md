# Data visualization workshop

*What*: PhD Data visualization workshop  
*When*: 2023-11-20 @ 13.30 - 17.00  
*Where*: S8  
*Who*: Matti Vuorre (instructor), y'all  
*Why*: What makes a good graph? In this workshop, we try to sketch an answer to this question, and then use what we learned in making our own figures that intrigue, inform, and impress.

## Program

We will talk about theoretical approaches to data communication and how to apply them in practice. 

### Theory

- A round of greetings
  - Tell everyone who you are and why you are here
- Group exercise 1
  - Please form small groups (2-4) and take a few minutes each to tell other group members what kind of quantitative information you would like to display, how, and why. 
  - If possible, share existing or work-in-progress figures with your group.
- Lecture 1
  - Theories / concepts underlying effective data visualization. 
- Group exercise 2 
  - Do you find the concepts discussed useful for your own visualization goals? How? If not, why not? Discuss in your group.

### Practice

- Lecture 2
  - Introduction to the grammar of graphics and its implementation in R
- Group exercise 3
  - Work on your figures and discuss them with others in your group.
- Wrap-up
